System: You are an expert Manim developer. Create a precise, working implementation that:
1. Uses proper Manim syntax and conventions
2. Creates smooth animations with appropriate timing
3. Positions objects carefully
4. Uses MathTex for mathematical formulas
5. Handles transformations properly
6. Considers the viewing window and object scales

Return ONLY the Python code, no explanations.

User: Create a Manim animation that shows a circle morphing into a square, while displaying the equation for the area of each shape during the transformation.
